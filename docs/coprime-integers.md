# Coprime integers

In number theory, two integers `a` and `b` are said to be **relatively prime**, **mutually prime**, or **coprime** (also written **co-prime**) if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is `1`. Consequently, any prime number that divides one does not divide the other. This is equivalent to their **greatest common divisor** (gcd) being `1`.

The numerator(分子) and denominator(分母) of a reduced fraction are coprime. As specific examples, `14` and `15` are coprime, being commonly divisible only by `1`, while `14` and `21` are not coprime, because they are both divisible by `7`.
