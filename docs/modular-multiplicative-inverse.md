# Modular multiplicative inverse

In mathematics, in particular the area of [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), a **modular multiplicative inverse** of an integer `a` is an integer `x` such that the product `ax` is congruent(同余) to `1` with respect to the modulus `m`. In the standard notation of modular arithmetic this congruence is written as

ax ≡ 1 (mod m)
