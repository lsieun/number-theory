# Turing Machine

A Turing machine is a theoretical computing machine invented by Alan Turing (1937) to serve as an idealized model for mathematical calculation. **A Turing machine** consists of **a line of cells known as a "tape"** that can be moved back and forth, **an active element known as the "head"** that possesses a property known as "state" and that can change the property known as "color" of the active cell underneath it, and **a set of instructions** for how the head should modify the active cell and move the tape (Wolfram 2002, pp. 78-81). At each step, the machine may modify the color of the active cell and change the state of the head. After this, it moves the tape one unit to the left or right.
